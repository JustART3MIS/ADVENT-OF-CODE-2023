# ADVENT-OF-CODE-2023
My resolution of the **[Advent of Code](adventofcode.com)** of 2023, mostly in **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**, using easy way to show new programmers way to do it even without being at a high programming level. 

Why make it complicated when you can make it simple ? :)

My IDE is  **Visual Studio Code**.

I'd like to give my thanks to @kewanfr for giving me the idea of making a GitHub Project out of it.
